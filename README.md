# Image Captioning using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for implementing a deep learning model for generating captions for images. The model is trained on the Flickr8K dataset, which consists of images along with corresponding captions.

## Overview

The task involves training a model to understand the content of an image and generate a human-like description of what is happening in the image. The model architecture leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

## Key Components

### VGG16

VGG16 is a pre-trained convolutional neural network used for extracting features from images. It's capable of recognizing various objects and patterns in images, which makes it suitable for this image captioning task.

### LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used for generating sequential data. In this project, LSTM is employed to generate captions word by word, considering the context of previous words.

### BLEU Score

BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of generated captions by comparing them to reference captions. It measures the similarity between the predicted and actual captions, providing insights into the model's performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-captioning.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the Flickr8K dataset and preprocess the data.

4. Train the image captioning model using the provided code.

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate captions for new images. Here's how to do it:

```python
# Load the trained model
model = load_model('img2txt_model.h5')

# Load an image
image = load_image('example.jpg')

# Generate a caption
caption = generate_caption(model, image)

print(caption)
```
## Results
The model achieved a BLEU-1 score of X and a BLEU-2 score of Y on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to generate accurate captions for images.
